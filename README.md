# Personal Porfolio

In this project, I have built a personal porfolio website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This page consists of 4 different sections (About Me, Projects, Work Experience and Contact Us Form). I have used WAVE and Lighthouse to test the accessibility of the page. For icons used across the page I used Box Icons. Future improvements for this page that I see myself doing in the future would be to add a dark mode/light mode theme button to toggle the theme. This project helped me build confidence to work comfortably on a front end website supporting various devices including mobile phones and tablets. I utilised Github pages to deploy this website which has been linked below
